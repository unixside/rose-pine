* Description

Rose Pine is an Emacs color theme inspired by the [[https://rosepinetheme.com/][Rose Pine]] design philosophy: "All natural pine, faux fur and a bit of soho vibes for the classy minimalist."

This theme provides three beautiful variants:
- *Main* - The default dark variant with deep, muted tones
- *Moon* - An alternative dark variant with slightly different hues
- *Dawn* - A light variant with warm, pastel colors

The theme supports a wide range of Emacs packages and modes including:
- Font Lock (syntax highlighting)
- Org Mode and Org Agenda
- Rainbow Delimiters
- Dired (with diredfl)
- VTerm
- Multiple Cursors
- And more!

* Installation

** Using straight.el with use-package

If you're using [[https://github.com/radian-software/straight.el][straight.el]] with [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]], add the following to your Emacs configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package rose-pine-theme
  :straight (:host github :repo "unixside/rose-pine")
  :config
  (load-theme 'rose-pine t))
#+end_src

Replace ~your-username/rose-pine~ with the actual GitHub repository path.

** Using straight.el without use-package

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(straight-use-package
 '(rose-pine-theme :type git :host github :repo "unixside/rose-pine"))
(load-theme 'rose-pine t)
#+end_src

** Manual Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   #+begin_src shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/rose-pine ~/.emacs.d/themes/rose-pine
   #+end_src

2. Add to your Emacs configuration:
   #+begin_src emacs-lisp
   (add-to-list 'custom-theme-load-path "~/.emacs.d/themes/rose-pine")
   (load-theme 'rose-pine t)
   #+end_src

* Configuration

** Basic Configuration

To load the theme with default settings:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(load-theme 'rose-pine t)
#+end_src

** Choosing a Variant

The theme supports toggling between dark and light variants, as well as choosing specific dark variants (Main or Moon).

*** Setting the Default Variant

To start with a specific variant, set ~rose-pine-variant~ before loading the theme:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Use the light variant (Dawn) by default
(setq rose-pine-variant 'light)
(load-theme 'rose-pine t)

;; Use the dark variant (Main or Moon) by default
(setq rose-pine-variant 'dark)
(load-theme 'rose-pine t)
#+end_src

*** Choosing Between Main and Moon (Dark Variants)

By default, the dark variant uses "Main". To use "Moon" instead:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq rose-pine-dark 'moon)
(setq rose-pine-variant 'dark)
(load-theme 'rose-pine t)
#+end_src

*** Example: Complete Configuration with use-package

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(use-package rose-pine-theme
  :straight (:host github :repo "unixside/rose-pine")
  :custom
  (rose-pine-variant 'dark)      ; Start with dark variant
  (rose-pine-dark 'main)         ; Use 'main' or 'moon'
  (rose-pine-light 'dawn)        ; Use 'dawn' (currently the only light option)
  :config
  (load-theme 'rose-pine t))
#+end_src

** Interactive Commands

*** Toggle Between Dark and Light

You can toggle between dark and light variants interactively:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x rose-pine-theme-toggle
#+end_src

Or bind it to a key:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(global-set-key (kbd "C-c t") #'rose-pine-theme-toggle)
#+end_src

*** Reload the Theme

If you change the variant settings, reload the theme to apply changes:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x rose-pine-theme-reload
#+end_src

** Accessing Colors Programmatically

You can access theme colors in your own configuration:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
;; Get a color from the current variant
(rose-pine-theme-color :red)
(rose-pine-theme-color :blue)

;; Get a color from a specific variant
(rose-pine-theme-color :magenta 'dark)
(rose-pine-theme-color :cyan 'light)
#+end_src

Available color names: ~:base~, ~:surface~, ~:overlay~, ~:muted~, ~:subtle~, ~:text~, ~:red~, ~:yellow~, ~:cyan~, ~:green~, ~:blue~, ~:magenta~, ~:hl-low~, ~:hl-med~, ~:hl-high~

** Using with ~rose-pine-with-colors~ Macro

For more complex configurations, you can use the ~rose-pine-with-colors~ macro:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(rose-pine-with-colors 'dark
  ;; All color variables are now bound: base, surface, text, red, etc.
  (set-face-attribute 'my-custom-face nil :foreground text :background base))
#+end_src

* Customization Groups

The theme uses the ~rose-pine-themes~ customization group. You can customize all theme options via:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x customize-group RET rose-pine-themes RET
#+end_src
